                <h1>USDA Loan Basics and Eligibility Requirements</h1>
                
                <h2>What is a USDA Loan?</h2>
                <p>USDA loans are government-backed mortgage loans designed to promote homeownership in rural and eligible suburban areas. These loans are backed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) under its Rural Development program.</p>
                
                <p>There are two main types of USDA home loans:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>USDA Guaranteed Loans</strong>: These are issued by private lenders but guaranteed by the USDA. They are available to low- to moderate-income borrowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>USDA Direct Loans</strong>: These are issued directly by the USDA to low- and very-low-income applicants who cannot obtain financing elsewhere.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2>Key Benefits of USDA Loans</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zero Down Payment</strong>: Perhaps the most attractive feature is that qualified borrowers can purchase a home with no down payment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Interest Rates</strong>: As of April 1, 2025, the USDA direct loan interest rate is 5.00%, which is significantly lower than conventional mortgage rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Mortgage Insurance Costs</strong>: Instead of traditional mortgage insurance, USDA loans have lower upfront and annual fees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Assistance</strong>: For direct loans, payment assistance can reduce the effective interest rate to as low as 1% for qualifying borrowers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible Credit Requirements</strong>: While a credit score of 640 is preferred, borrowers with lower scores may still qualify with additional documentation.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Eligibility Requirements for 2025</h2>
                
                <h3>Income Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Household income must not exceed specific limits set by the USDA.</li>
                    <li>For 2025, a household of 1-4 people must make less than $112,450, and a household of 5-8 people must make less than $148,450 to qualify.</li>
                    <li>Income limits vary by location and are typically set at:
                        <ul>
                            <li>For guaranteed loans: 115% of the area median income</li>
                            <li>For direct loans: 80% of the area median income</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Property Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The property must be located in an eligible rural area as defined by the USDA.</li>
                    <li>Despite being called "Rural Development" loans, many suburban areas qualify.</li>
                    <li>According to USDA data, approximately 97% of U.S. land is within USDA-eligible boundaries.</li>
                    <li>The property must be the borrower's primary residence.</li>
                    <li>The home must meet specific safety and livability standards.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Location Eligibility Criteria</h3>
                <p>To be considered rural by the USDA, an area must fall into one of these categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The area has no more than 10,000 residents.</li>
                    <li>If the area has 10,001-20,000 residents, it cannot be in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and must have a serious lack of mortgage credit for low and moderate-income families.</li>
                    <li>If the area has 20,001-35,000 residents, it must have once been considered rural but lost that status in the 1990, 2000, or 2010 Census, and also have a serious lack of mortgage credit options.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Borrower Requirements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be a U.S. citizen, U.S. non-citizen national, or qualified alien</li>
                    <li>Have the legal capacity to incur the loan obligation</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate willingness and ability to repay debt</li>
                    <li>Be unable to obtain a loan from other resources on reasonable terms</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>USDA Loan Fees and Costs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Upfront Guarantee Fee</strong>: For fiscal year 2025 (Oct 1, 2024 - Sep 30, 2025), the upfront fee is 1% of the loan amount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual Fee</strong>: 0.35% of the remaining principal balance, paid monthly.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Down Payment</strong>: Typically, no down payment is required.</li>
                    <li><strong>Closing Costs</strong>: Like other mortgage loans, borrowers must pay closing costs, typically 2-5% of the purchase price.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>How to Apply for a USDA Loan</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Determine Eligibility</strong>: Use the USDA eligibility site to determine if your income and the property location qualify.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose a Lender</strong>: For guaranteed loans, work with a USDA-approved private lender. For direct loans, contact your local USDA Rural Development office.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prequalification</strong>: Get prequalified to determine your borrowing potential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Property Search</strong>: Find a property in an eligible area that meets USDA requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Formal Application</strong>: Submit a complete application with all required documentation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Underwriting</strong>: The lender (for guaranteed loans) or USDA (for direct loans) will review your application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Closing</strong>: If approved, proceed to closing where you'll sign paperwork and finalize the loan.</li>
                </ol>
